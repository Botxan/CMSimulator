# CMSimulator
This application serves as a simulator of how the data is accessed and transfered from main memory (MM) to cache memory (CM) and vice versa.

The repository has been created as a project for Computer Architecture subject.

Configure the simulator to your needs: memory and block sizes, access times and also writing, placement and replacement policies.

Enter an address or generate a random one in the Instruction section. You can now control the flow of the simulator using the buttons in the Simulation messages section.

Access times and hit/miss rate are displayed in the chart below the table, as well as the calculus used for the address breakdown.
